Quantum model for a linear 3 sites cluster
==========================================

Building and diagonalizing a quantum model for a linear cluster with 3 sites. I will use [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) package for doing the real job.

This is part of my PhD thesis.
